Traceability Matrix — Day01
=========================

Purpose
-------
Maintain bidirectional linkage between requirements, test scenarios, and evidence artifacts.

Recommended Columns
-------------------
- Requirement ID and criticality
- Verification method and scenario ID
- Artifact location (log/plot/report)
- Verdict and issue linkage
- Owner and last update timestamp

Usage Rules
-----------
- No test scenario without requirement reference.
- No requirement marked complete without evidence artifact.
- Any requirement change triggers matrix review.

Quick Audit Checks
------------------
- Are failed tests linked to corrective actions?
- Are all critical requirements covered by at least one negative-path test?
- Are artifact links still valid and reproducible?

Additional Deep-Dive Notes
--------------------------
- Domain Focus: General
- Phase Focus: MIL
- Evidence Priorities: functional correctness, timing behavior, robustness, and traceability.
- Patterns: baseline-first comparison, fixed acceptance thresholds, deterministic reruns.
- Anti-Patterns: post-hoc threshold tuning, missing raw artifacts, incomplete negative-path checks.
- Pitfalls: hidden assumptions, interface timing drift, weak requirement-to-test linkage.
- Example Expansion: include one nominal, one boundary, and one fault scenario per objective.
- Review Heuristic: if a claim cannot be tied to an artifact, mark confidence as provisional.
- Checklist Extension: capture residual risk, ownership, and next action for each unresolved item.
