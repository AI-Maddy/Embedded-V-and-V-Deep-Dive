Theory — Day03 Plant and Controller Modeling
===========================================

Learning Goal
-------------
Model plant dynamics and controller logic so simulation evidence remains meaningful for downstream phases.

Modeling Essentials
-------------------
- Plant models represent environment and physics constraints.
- Controller models encode decision logic and safety boundaries.
- Interface contracts (units/ranges/rates) must be explicit.

Validation Focus
----------------
- Numerical stability under expected operating envelopes.
- Sensitivity to disturbances and parameter variation.
- Correct mode transitions and fallback behavior.

Evidence to Capture
-------------------
- Model assumptions and parameter set versions.
- Baseline and disturbed-run comparisons.
- Identified model limitations and confidence boundaries.

Additional Deep-Dive Notes
--------------------------
- Domain Focus: General
- Phase Focus: MIL
- Evidence Priorities: functional correctness, timing behavior, robustness, and traceability.
- Patterns: baseline-first comparison, fixed acceptance thresholds, deterministic reruns.
- Anti-Patterns: post-hoc threshold tuning, missing raw artifacts, incomplete negative-path checks.
- Pitfalls: hidden assumptions, interface timing drift, weak requirement-to-test linkage.
- Example Expansion: include one nominal, one boundary, and one fault scenario per objective.
- Review Heuristic: if a claim cannot be tied to an artifact, mark confidence as provisional.
- Checklist Extension: capture residual risk, ownership, and next action for each unresolved item.
